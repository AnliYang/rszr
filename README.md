# RSZR
#### Service for requesting raw and resized images.

## To run RSZR locally:
* using the latest version of node... running v8.12.0
* `then put in this codez`
* `moar codez`

## To add for dev:
* nodemon
* linter

## Bugs and To Do's:
* Currently able to serve raw gifs, but resizing results in what appears to be just one frame from the gif (resized).
* Add more helpful errors for helping users who submit malformed requests.
